## Godot-Widgets

A collection of widgets that are useful for GUIs. Inspired by [KivyMD](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io).

Widgets are highly customizable, check their properties in the Godot Editor. If you feel that something is missing or there is a bug, please, open a new issue.

If you download the full repository, you will get a small showcase project.

### FilteredEdits (v2.0.0)

The original addon [FilteredEdits](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1992) has been embedded into this plugin to avoid dependencies issues. There is no problem since I'm the same author. **Attention: this makes this plugin incompatible with FilteredEdits, disable or remove that plugin, you will find the same functions here.**
