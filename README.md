A collection of widgets that are useful for GUIs.

### FilteredEdits (v2.0.0)

The original addon [FilteredEdits](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1992) has been embedded into this plugin to avoid dependencies issues. There is no problem since I'm the same author. **Attention: this makes this plugin incompatible with FilteredEdits, disable or remove that plugin, you will find the same functions here.**

### IconButton

A button that consists on an icon. You might have to set its `custom_minimum_size` if used inside a `Container` or any of its variations.

---

### NavBar
